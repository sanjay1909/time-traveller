# TimeTraveller

TimeTraveller is a state management library that provides undo, redo, delete, and jump-to-state functionality. It's designed for both plain JavaScript and React applications. The library uses [fast-json-patch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-json-patch) to store state differences and allows state tagging for filtering purposes.

## Installation

Install the library using npm:

```bash
npm install time-traveller
``
